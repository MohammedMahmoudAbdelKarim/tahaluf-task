// Category-based Question Flow: Show questions based on the selected category, sorted by difficulty (easy → medium → hard).

// Question Controls: Based on the type of question (multiple choice, boolean, or free-text), appropriate input controls (dropdown, checkbox, or text area) will be rendered.

// Navigation and Answer Validation: A "Next" button that’s disabled until the answer is selected and a "Previous" button that’s always enabled.

// Result Calculation: After all questions are completed, show results with weighted scores:
// Hard = 5 points
// Medium = 3 points
// Easy = 1 point
